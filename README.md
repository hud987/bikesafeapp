# Bike Alert Mobile App

BikeAlert is a mobile app to alert drivers of nearby bicyclists. The app can be used by both bicyclists and drivers. Bicyclists send their location to a database during a ride and drivers see relevant bicyclists on their map.

## Motiviation

Each year in the US, ~800 cyclists die in automobile accidents. These collisions could be reduced if automobile drivers were more aware of nearby bicyclists. Since most bicyclists carry their phones during rides, a phone app could increase safety.
